Episode: 2 Igniting our APP

(1) -> package.json is a configuration file for our packages that is for our project that we will install in our project using NPM

(2) -> Bundler - Used to bundle our project file in efficient way to make it shipable/Production-ready. ex. vite, parcel, webpack, etc.

(3) -> Dev. Dependencies requires while we are developing, Normal dependency is used in production.

(4) -> tilde (~), (^) caret (^) -> is for Automatic minor upgradation (Preferrable) (~) -> is for any major automatic upgradation.

(5) -> Package-lock.json 
        - Keeps a hash version (integrity) 
        -Keeps exact version of every dependency.

(6) Transitive dependencies -> Dependencies for a primary dependency

(6) -> We can re-install all the node modules Using package.json Hence,node_modules doesnot need to be in production (or pushed to GitHub)

(7) we Donot use React via CDN
                -New version availability
                -Unnecessary network calls

(8) Normal JS file Doesnot have import so we declare "module" when linking JS file to our HTML.

(9) Parcel: -> Dev-Build / Production-Build 
            -> Creates local server 
            -> HMR (Hot module replacement) 
            -> File watching Algorithm - written in C++ 
            -> Caching - Faster builds 
            -> Image optimization 
            -> minification of files 
            -> It will do Bundling of files 
            -> Compressing of files 
            -> Consistent Hashing 
            -> Code splitting 
            -> Differential Bundling 
            -> Diagnostics 
            -> Error Handling 
            -> HTTPS Server 
            -> Tree shaking algorithm i.e remove unused code

Episode:3 Laying the foundation

#j.son script to start and build a project is
        - "npm run start"/ "npm start" -> to start the project
        - "npm run build "  - is to build the project
# React element is an object and when we render it into ReactDOM it becomes HTML
# jsx is different from HTML having similar syntax like HTMl as js engine only understand ES
   "Parcel" transpille jsx into js using "babel"
    we use camaleCase in jsx

# React component start with Upper case

#Types of React components
        ->class based component(old way)
        ->function based component(new way)
          ie. a js function which return Reactelement made using jsx
          
# component composition is putiing component inside a component
