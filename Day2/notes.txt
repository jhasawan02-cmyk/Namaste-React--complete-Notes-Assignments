Episode: 2 Igniting our APP

(1) -> package.json is a configuration file for our packages that is for our project that we will install in our project using NPM

(2) -> Bundler - Used to bundle our project file in efficient way to make it shipable/Production-ready. ex. vite, parcel, webpack, etc.

(3) -> Dev. Dependencies requires while we are developing, Normal dependency is used in production.

(4) -> tilde (~), (^) caret (^) -> is for Automatic minor upgradation (Preferrable) (~) -> is for any major automatic upgradation.

(5) -> Package-lock.json 
        - Keeps a hash version (integrity) 
        -Keeps exact version of every dependency.

(6) Transitive dependencies -> Dependencies for a primary dependency

(6) -> We can re-install all the node modules Using package.json Hence,node_modules doesnot need to be in production (or pushed to GitHub)

(7) we Donot use React via CDN
                -New version availability
                -Unnecessary network calls

(8) Normal JS file Doesnot have import so we declare "module" when linking JS file to our HTML.

(9) Parcel: -> Dev-Build / Production-Build 
            -> Creates local server 
            -> HMR (Hot module replacement) 
            -> File watching Algorithm - written in C++ 
            -> Caching - Faster builds 
            -> Image optimization 
            -> minification of files 
            -> It will do Bundling of files 
            -> Compressing of files 
            -> Consistent Hashing 
            -> Code splitting 
            -> Differential Bundling 
            -> Diagnostics 
            -> Error Handling 
            -> HTTPS Server 
            -> Tree shaking algorithm i.e remove unused code



Episode:3 Laying the foundation



#j.son script to start and build a project is
        - "npm run start"/ "npm start" -> to start the project
        - "npm run build "  - is to build the project
# React element is an object and when we render it into ReactDOM it becomes HTML
# jsx is different from HTML having similar syntax like HTMl as js engine only understand ES
   "Parcel" transpille jsx into js using "babel"
    we use camaleCase in jsx

# React component start with Upper case

#Types of React components
        ->class based component(old way)
        ->function based component(new way)
          ie. a js function which return Reactelement made using jsx
          
# component composition is putiing component inside a component



Episode:4 Talk is cheap , show me the code




/* design the layout and components before writing the code */

# Passing a prop to a component is similar to passing an argument to a js function
# Config. Driven UI means the UI will change as the configuration data changes
   -> (ex. different UI for a single Website based on Geographical location of user)

# Props ex. < RestaurantCard (resname="") /->

 Self Explanation ==> we send this "Prop" that is created in each card </->  and then send it into the factory
 where all these cards are beign made , defining the "Layout" for each such "Props"

# Destructuring  Methods of Props recived as Para meters for card layout(i.e factory) methods;
        Ex::
                1 -> on the fly: ({resName,cousines})

                2 -> const[resName,cousines] = Props
                   : in this qwe are telling the programme to look into the props and make variable out of each name as well
                   i.e here, variable name is same as the content of the prop

                3 ->  normal method: in layout( props.resName,props.cousines)

Self Explanation ==>  Props follow this sequence
 1> Kya data dalna he?(for each card)
 2> kese(Position/Layout) Data dalna he har ek card me
 3> Kitne Card me data dalna he
 4> Wapas bata do kitna card banaya he

# Always give "Key" we we use ".Map" for number of card looping
  -> no "key" >>> index as "key" >>>>>>>>>> unique "key" 



Episode:5 Let's get hooked


# Two types of export : 
        1. Name export
         ex: export const "component"
             import {"component"} from path

        2. Default export(cannot be used for more than one export)
         ex: export default "component"
             import "component" from "Path"

# React Hooks: useState() and useEffect()  
  => Reconciliation Algorithm(React Fibre)
    -> React uses VirtualDOM as a representation of Html Tags which is just a nested JS Object
  => Diff Algorithm 
    -> React keeps  checking the original virtual dom and new virtual dom and updates the changes only
